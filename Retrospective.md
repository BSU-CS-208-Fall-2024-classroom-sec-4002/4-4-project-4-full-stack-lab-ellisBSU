## Experience

I tested my project by starting the server and manually doing get, post, and delete requests. I did this to make sure the behavior was working as intended. I struggled with figuring out why the server could not read the local variable 'local' on a get request but after some time I realized that I was only passing the 'local' variable inside the post request in the 'render' function and not in the get request too. Nothing was poorly specified. I knew how the web page had to interact for it to be considered complete because of the walkthrough video that was included. I was able to get the entire project done by following the examples that were included in the assignment. One new thing I learned from this project was how to start using a database inside of a server. The database allows developers to do all the CRUD operations through the functionality that is implemented in the database module. One thing I would like to share is that I had a fun time learning how to build a simple full stack project. I like how the walkthrough video noted that this project was similar to a "Hello World" program where it was mostly focused on building familiarity with full stack development therefore there was nothing too tricky about the project. I also liked how data in a database could be stored in memory instead of some file which makes it easier for testing since I am not interested in that data after I have finished testing. 

## Known issues or Bugs

NONE

## Sources used

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit - I used this source to figure out how to change the text value of
the submit button. 

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp - I used this source to figure out how to add a horizontal line across the web page like the
example shown. It is used to separate the input textbox and the todo list. According to this source, it is done by adding the hr tag.
